# RFCS

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for changes to HetuDB (such as new features) so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction of the project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the HetuDB community and the sub-teams.

Please use and reference [RFC process](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0002-rfc-process.html)
